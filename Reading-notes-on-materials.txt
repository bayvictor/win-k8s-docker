1) With billions of transistors on a single chip, the silicon MOSFET is the mostreplicated man made structure in human history.
2) silicon material system has two additional properties that make it particularly promising for building qubits. The first is the predominance
of spin-zero 28Si nuclei in silicon which can be isotopically purified to create a spin free host nicknamed the so-called
“semiconductor vacuum” (12). This, and the second property of having a small spin-orbit coupling which suppresses
phonon and spin orbit based decoherence mechanisms, make silicon based qubits inherently resilient to errors.
