Q1. Why have to be careful running k8s+docker in windows 10?
A1. You can enable and disable the Hyper-V hypervisor at will, but it requires a restart of your computer.

If you're frequently switching from containers to virtual machines, perhaps minikube is a more convenient choice. You don't need to restart your computer when you change from containers to virtual machines.

Docker for Windows workaround for VirtualBox/VMWare 


Skip to end of metadata

Go to start of metadata

Issue: Just having Hyper-V activated will prevent other tools from being able to start a VM, even if Docker for Windows is stopped.
Cause: VirtualBox and VMWare are type 2 hypervisors whereas Docker for Windows users Hyper-V which is a type 1 hypervisor.
Workaround setup:
Run an elevated command prompt
bcdedit /copy {current} /d "No Hyper-V"
Copy the GUID generated by the previous command and replace "GUID" below
bcdedit /set {GUID} hypervisorlaunchtype off
Switch:
Go to Start Menu
Click the power button
Hold down the Shift key
Select "Restart"
After reboot, choose "Use another operating system"
Select "No Hyper-V"
Now you can start VirtualBox or VMWare without having to uninstall Docker for Windows.

Reading notes:
Pain points beyond use cases:
source:https://uxdesign.cc/personas-jtbd-user-needs-goals-pain-points-7eaa81976f0
Unmet needs = goals + pain points

(1) It is extremely critical to discover unmet user needs through research for both personas and jobs-to-be-done. 
Any unmet needs will always have two components:

    1.1. The goal: What you want to accomplish and why you want to accomplish it.
    1.2. The pain point: What stopped you from accomplishing it.
    1.3. next step: ask several levels deeper into "why you feel pain? how does it often happen?"

FOUNDATIONAL VDI with a focus on user experience and security.  This knowledge comes from years of field experience 
building many generations/evolutions on Microsoft, Citrix, and VMware VDI centric solution stacks as well as tons of 
great info from my peers in the community.
Lessons: (2.1) <b>Build foundation first </b>.
Don’t be a reactive VDI "angry" implementer. (because existing VDI won't fit you at first beginning).  
Be proactive and build the foundation for VDI correctly up front so you can: 
(2.1a) answer any use case that comes up in the future. (2.1b) pain points. 
(2.2) <b>Budget. </b>
Understand: (2.2.1) the total cost of ownership; (2.2.2) as well as per user cost to run your service before you begin. 
(2.2.3) Ensure you have a realistic budget.

(3) Dell, HP and IBM offering NVIDIA GRID-based server, Citrix, Microsoft and Vmware offering GRID-enabled software, 
can be multiple users per GPU/NVidia.
(4) XenApp 7.0: Preisberechnung: 300 concurrent User, Enterprise Edition, Easy Licensing Bestehender.
for: XenApp/ -XenDesktop/-XenClient/ -ProvisioningServices /-XenServer
{ Additional Microsoft licenses
• It requires a VDA license for every connection to a Microsoft virtual machine via XenDesktop
• If the user starts a published application of XenApp via the VDI, the user needs an RDSH license on the Microsoft server
• Citrix has deviceLicensing, no matter which products the user needs, only one license is charged
}

(5) Talk to people with a lot of EUC (end-user computing) experience in the areas of VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) 
and SBC (server-based computing) to avoid Sales Noices of BS. Refer to youtube+VDI is also good!
(6) Set expectations: A virtual desktop will never be an identical experience to a physical desktop.
(7) Use cases & pain points: Sit down and spend time to understand everyone’s needs and work together toward that goal.
(8) Azure AD + Azure MFA using Microsoft Authenticator is powerful. 
Okta UD + Okta MFA using Okta Verify is simple to deploy and powerful as well.
