Q1. Why have to be careful running k8s+docker in windows 10?
A1. You can enable and disable the Hyper-V hypervisor at will, but it requires a restart of your computer.

If you're frequently switching from containers to virtual machines, perhaps minikube is a more convenient choice. You don't need to restart your computer when you change from containers to virtual machines.

Docker for Windows workaround for VirtualBox/VMWare

Issue: Just having Hyper-V activated will prevent other tools from being able to start a VM, even if Docker for Windows is stopped.
Cause: VirtualBox and VMWare are type 2 hypervisors whereas Docker for Windows users Hyper-V which is a type 1 hypervisor.
Workaround setup:
Run an elevated command prompt
bcdedit /copy {current} /d "No Hyper-V"
Copy the GUID generated by the previous command and replace "GUID" below
bcdedit /set {GUID} hypervisorlaunchtype off
Switch:
Go to Start Menu
Click the power button
Hold down the Shift key
Select "Restart"
After reboot, choose "Use another operating system"
Select "No Hyper-V"
Now you can start VirtualBox or VMWare without having to uninstall Docker for Windows.
