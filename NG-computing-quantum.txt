States of entangled qubits cannot be described independently of each other. Non-local action is possible.  2 qubits equal to 512 classical bits, 3 qubits 1024 bits, 35 is 550 Gbits.  n qubits has 2n paths which creates an equal superposition of all 2n states.  The problem:  encode the program onto the system by applying all 2n states.  The magic: interfere all states back to a few outcomes containing the solution.  Shor’s algorithm, factor a number into primes M = p*q.  Classical t~exp(O(n0.33*log0.66n)).  Quantum t~O(n3).  Qiskit is available on-line to write quantum computers.  IBM’s quantum computer operates at 15mK.  Superconducting Qubit: Josephson Junction as a non-linear inductor.  Superconducting microwave resonators: read-out of qubit states, multi-qubit quantum bus, and noise filter.  Coherence time is 50-100microseconds.  Push coherence time to larger time and to have error correction.  In quantum volume consideration, decrease the error rate rather than just increasing number of qubits.  In the 2020s, real world problems will be solved on quantum computers. In quantum chemistry research, IBM has simulated beryllium hydride BeH2 molecule with 8 Qubits.  Number of calculations on classical computer complexity is 2^number of electrons.  On Qubit computer complexity is number of electrons (one qubit per electron).  There is a relationship between quantum computing and machine learning.  Linear inseparable datasets may become linearly separable by increasing dimensionality.  In quantum computers, Hilbert space of the machine learning (ML) problem is modeled.  Classification success of ML improves as the number of entanglement steps increases.  Three ways to break up a problem, run part on classical von nueman CPU, part on AI chip, and part on quantum.  Fabricating requires breaking the 2-D plane into 3-D but will always will require super conducting.  Quantum computing does not have a Danard’s law (yet).  Minimum feature size of the Qbit is 100nm.  Limitation of coherence time is not fully understood yet.  There are photon based qubit approaches.
